# Expansion

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time weighted average price (TWAP) of KEEN is greater than 1.01, new KEEN will be minted in the boardroom.

The amount of new KEEN distributed depends on the current circulating supply of KEEN.

10 thousand is removed from the circulating supply because of initial smart contract reasons.

(Note: **the expansion rates are misleadingly low** due to the fact that there is an extra 10,000 KEEN that is counted in the treasury's circulating supply, a smart contract error. Add 10,000 to the total supply before doing calculations.)

| Circulating Supply | Expansion Rate |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Below 1000         | 2.5%           |
| Up to 1500         | 2%             |
| Up to 2000         | 1.5%           |
| Up to 2500         | 1%             |
| Up to 3000         | 0.5%           |
| Up to 3500         | 0.25%          |
| Up to 4000         | 0.2%           |
| Up to 4500         | 0.1%           |
| 4500+              | 0.1%           |
