## Whitepaper

The $KEEN algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the Avalanche C-Chain.

The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $KEEN's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $AVAX.

<!--more-->

Inspired by the original idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup) and then by Tomb Finance, iKeen Finance is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens:
- KEEN pegged token ($KEEN).
- KEEN Shares ($iSKEEN)
- KEEN Bonds ($iBKEEN).

## What differentiates $KEEN from other algorithmic tokens?
Unlike some other algorithmic tokens, $KEEN is not pegged to a stable coin— it is instead pegged to $AVAX.

## Why is this?
iKeen Finance believes in the potential of the Avalanche C-Chain due to the high daily volume and several characteristics like:

- Instant transaction speed: Generally, it instantly confirms transactions
Solidity-compatible: Many DApps are created on the Avalanche C-Chain every day, which is a main point of the blockchain.

- Highly Scalable: AVAX has a large "hidden" potential. In the future, we believe that many other crypto projects will prefer to build their dapps on this network instead of others.

- Security: Avalanche scales to millions of validators through its groundbreaking Snowman consensus.

- Private & public blockchains: You can create subnets with custom rules.



## TOKENS

### KEEN
The $KEEN token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain KEEN's peg to 1 AVAX in the long run.

### iSKEEN
Keen Shares ($iSKEEN) are one of the ways to measure the value of the iKeen Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain $KEEN close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints $KEEN and distributes it proportionally to all $iSKEEN holders who have staked their tokens in the Galaxy (boardroom).

$iSKEEN holders will have voting rights (governance) on proposals in the future to improve the protocol and future use cases within the iKeen Finance ecosystem. $iSKEEN has a maximum total supply of 100,000 tokens distributed as follows:

- Liquidity providers for pools on the SPIRAL: 50000 $iSKEEN are allocated for incentivizing Liquidity Providers in two shares pools for 12 months.
- DAO allocation: 10000 $iSKEEN vested gradually over a year.
- Team allocation: 30000 $iSKEEN vested gradually over a year.10 000 $ISKEEN from team allocation will be dedicated to Marketing , Giveaways and Burns.

The remaining 10000 $iSKEEN are dedicated for the ICO, a small part of the funds will be used to create initial liquidity to kickstart the protocol. The rest of the funds from ICO will be used for marketing, team allocation and for other needs of the protocol. The cost per token on the ICO will be 10$/iSKEEN.

### iBKEEN
Keen Bonds ($iBKEEN)'s main job is to help incentivize an upward price movement in $KEEN. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of $keen falls below 1 AVAX, iBKEEN is issued and can be bought with $KEEN at the current price.

Exchanging $KEEN for $iBKEEN burns these tokens, taking them out of circulation temporarily and helping to get the price back up and above 1 AVAX.

These $iBKEEN can be redeemed for $KEEN when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg.

This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for $keen when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 AVAX.

$iBKEEN bonds are available for purchase when $KEEN falls below the 1 AVAX peg. If $KEEN's TWAP is between 1.00 and 1.01, neither $iBKEEN bonds nor $KEEN will be issued.

> e.g. if KEEN's TWAP < 1, exchange $keen for $ibkeen bond will be in a 1:1 ratio.

$iBKEEN is available for redemption when $KEEN goes above the 1 AVAX peg. To encourage redemption of $iBKEEN for $KEEN when $KEEN's TWAP > 1.1 and incentivize users to redeem at a higher price, bond redemption will be more profitable with a higher KEEN TWAP, of which $iBKEEN to $KEEN ratio will be 1:R where R can be calculated in the formula as shown below:
> R = 1 + ((twap) − 1) ∗ coeff)
coeff = 0.7

## KEEN Distribution

### Initial Genesis Pools

### GALAXY (Boardroom)
![](https://i.snap.as/PoMskryL.jpg)

The epoch duration will be 6 hours.

Deposits/Withdrawals/Claims of $iSKEEN shares into the Galaxy will lock this $iSKEEN for 6 epochs and $KEEN rewards will be claimable in 3 epochs after a deposit/withdraw/claim.

### Distribution of $KEEN above peg
The maximum supply of $KEEN is uncapped.
This is simply how $KEEN will be distributed.

80% as Reward for Boardroom $iSKEEN Stakers
18% goes to DAO fund
2% goes to developers to fund development and other expenses

Epoch Expansion: The current expansion cap is based on $KEEN supply. If there are bonds to be redeemed, 65% of minted $KEEN goes to the Treasury until it is sufficiently full to meet bond redemption. If there is no debt, it will use the max capped expansion rate.

### GALAXY below peg

Stakers of $iSKEEN in the GALAXY will not receive any $KEEN while TWAP is below 1.01 AVAX.

### GALAXY in Debt Phase
A Debt Phase takes place during the expansion epochs that start after a contraction period when there are still $iBKEEN bonds to be redeemed.
65% of Expansion during the Debt Phase is allocated to the Treasury Fund to prepare for the redemption of $iBKEEN. This amount is still reserved whether or not $iBKEEN bonds holders are redeeming bonds or not.

Once the amount of $KEEN in treasury is sufficiently full to meet all circulating bond redemption, expansion rates will resume to normal. $iBKEEN bonds emitted per epoch during contraction periods can be found on Regulations.
