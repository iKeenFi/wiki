> iKeen is a DeFi protocol on the Avalanche C-Chain pegged through seigniorage to the value of 1 AVAX.

iKeen works by inflating the KEEN supply when above peg (1 KEEN > 1.01 AVAX) and selling bonds when lower than peg (1 KEEN < 1.01 AVAX) to incentivize a peg to 1 AVAX. iKeen is a fork of Bomb Money.
