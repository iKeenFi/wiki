### $KEEN

The $KEEN token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain KEEN's peg to 0.1 AVAX in the long run.

### $iSKEEN

Keen Shares ($iSKEEN) are one of the ways to measure the value of the iKeen Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain $KEEN close to peg. During epoch expansions the protocol mints $KEEN and distributes it proportionally to all $iSKEEN holders who have staked their tokens in the Galaxy (boardroom).

$iSKEEN holders will have voting rights (governance) on proposals in the future to improve the protocol and future use cases within the iKeen Finance ecosystem.

### $iBKEEN

Keen Bonds ($iBKEEN)'s main job is to help incentivize an upward price movement in $KEEN. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of $keen falls below 1 AVAX, iBKEEN is issued and can be bought with $KEEN at the current price.

Exchanging $KEEN for $iBKEEN burns these tokens, taking them out of circulation temporarily and helping to get the price back up and above 1 AVAX.

These $iBKEEN can be redeemed for $KEEN when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg.

This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for $KEEN when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 AVAX.
