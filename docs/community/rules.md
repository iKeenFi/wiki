# Community Rules

To keep the iKeen community a welcoming and awesome place for people to talk about stuff without being harassed or insulted, we have a set of community rules. The list is meant to be small because we don't want to unnecessarily clamp down on discussion.

### 1. Be nice (this means no hate speech, racism, etc!)

Some half-hearted jokes are fine, but in general you should be nice, ~~you idiotic porcupine spoonface~~! This rule also means no hate speech, sexism, racism, etc.

### 2. Use channels for their intended purposes

It's fine for channels to get a little off topic but you shouldn't start talking in #general-chat about, I don't know, elections for emperor penguin in Antarctica. iKeen memes are allowed anywhere.

### 3. Please no NSFW

Don't start spamming... erm, certain types of pictures in general chat. It's fine in NSFW channels but keep it away from everything else.

### 4. No shilling outside of marked channels

And I don't mean the coin kind of shilling, I mean the verb to shill. Don't advertise other projects outside of there. Nobody wants this server to turn into a dump filled with low-quality projects, so control yourself and just go to a channel to vomit out your invites to this awesome 1000% daily degen whatever.

### 5. Please no spam/flood

Please don't spam whatever awesome message you've got to say. Once or twice is enough.

### 6. **NO SCAMMING!**

Please don't send scam links or try to DM scam people. Please don't. Just no.

### 7. Follow the ToS of what chat platform you use

No further explanation needed.
